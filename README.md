# Hybrid Content-Based + Knowledge-Based Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines
content-based analysis with a knowledge-based rule engine to generate
personalized metabolic recommendations for breast cancer patients.

The system analyzes a patient’s metabolic biomarker profile, compares it
to healthy reference values, assigns a severity context using clustering,
and produces explainable, evidence-based recommendations.
